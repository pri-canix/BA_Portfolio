Lion Studios focuses on games with simple gameplay mechanics, such as tapping or swiping. Ketchapp has a portfolio of games with simple mechanics as well, but they are known for their visually appealing graphics.</p>

However, Voodoo stands out for its unique approach to user acquisition by using mini-games within their games as a way to promote other games within their portfolio.</p>

                                          All three companies primarily rely on in-game advertising as their main source of revenue. However, Voodoo also incorporates rewarded video ads that offer in-game currency or extra lives, providing a more engaging and satisfying experience for the user.</p>

                                       <p>Lion Studios and Ketchapp focus on creating visually appealing games with simple controls that are easy for users to pick up and play. Voodoo also focuses on creating games that are easy to learn, but also add a unique twist or challenge to keep the user engaged. Overall, the three companies have similar approaches to game development, with a focus on simplicity, addictive gameplay, and bright, colorful graphics.</p>
