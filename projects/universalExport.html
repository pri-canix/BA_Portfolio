                <p>Dear esteemed investors,</p>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/infographics/universalExport/data viz-1.png" alt="Universal Export’s sales and profit trend in 2023">

                <p>Throughout the fiscal year 2023, sales and profit exhibited fluctuations, showcasing notable highs and lows. August recorded the highest sales at 9711 units, while February marked the lowest at 8251 units exported. Surprisingly, profit trends did not mirror sales trends.</p>
                <p>February, the lowest-performing month, saw profits at GBP 271M, contrasting with August's peak sales. The correlation between higher sales and increased profitability underscores the significance of sales performance in driving overall profitability. This highlights the importance of associated products contributing to sales and profit figures, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between sales volume and financial outcomes.</p>

                <p class="dream-subhead">Bifurcation of product categories and analysis</p>

                <p>Universal Export's diverse product range includes t-shirts, hoodies, and fake knitted cardigans, among others. The sales and profit figures mentioned earlier stem from the sale of these varied products. T-shirts and hoodies emerge as the top-selling categories, with a slight difference of 100 units between them, selling 28.4k and 28.3k units, respectively. These product categories exhibit significant demand among customers. In contrast, sales of cardigans stand at 9.1k units, while polo shirts, sweatshirts, and jackets occupy the middle ground with a combined total of 44.4k units sold in 2023. This analysis highlights the varying levels of demand for different product categories within Universal Export's portfolio.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/infographics/universalExport/data viz-2.png" alt="Bifurcation of product categories and analysis">

                <p>It's notable that the sales figures for T-Shirts and Hoodies are remarkably close, indicating strong demand for these products across Universal Export's customer base. Conversely, the significant gap between the top-selling and lower-performing categories suggests potential opportunities for product development, marketing strategies, or pricing adjustments to boost sales of the weaker product lines.</p>
                <p>The primary product categories are ranked by sales quantity, with T-Shirts and Hoodies emerging as the top performers. Within these categories, the Unisex T-Shirt and Standard Hoodie subcategories generate the highest revenues, with £120M and £79M respectively.</p>
                <p>The analysis of profitability indicates that Hoodies and T-Shirts are the most lucrative categories, boasting margins of 33.6% and 33.3%, respectively. Conversely, cardigans exhibit the lowest profitability, with a margin of 15.32% and total profit of £329.93M. On further breakdown of profit margin reveals sweatshirts as the top contributor, with a profit margin of 18.21%.</p>
                <p>In terms of total sales, product subcategories collectively generated £56M in revenue, with Military Jackets yielding the lowest revenue at £26M, indicating weaker performance. This profitability analysis offers valuable insights into each product line's financial performance, with Hoodies (£884.27M) and T-Shirts (£885.52M) emerging as the most profitable categories. Unisex T-Shirts notably stand out as customer favourites, contributing significantly to Universal Export's global success with sales totalling £961M.</p>
                <p>Our robust sales and profit figures, particularly in the T-shirt and Hoodie categories, underscore our market dominance and customer appeal. However, challenges remain, such as the need to revitalize underperforming product lines like cardigans and military jackets.</p>

                <p class="dream-subhead">Geographic sales performance comparison</p>
                <p>Universal Export's global success can be attributed to its extensive export operations, reaching various countries worldwide. The sales insights across different countries reveal interesting trends. The United Kingdom and Ireland emerge as the largest contributors, with the UK alone generating £1026M in sales and £889M in profit, surpassing other European nations significantly. Several Western and Central European countries record sales ranging from £200M to £250M, while countries like Austria and Portugal exhibit lower sales below £100M. Similar profit patterns are observed. However, it's important to acknowledge the environmental impact associated with global exports, considering transportation modes such as air, sea, and land routes utilized for delivering packages to destination countries.</p>

                <p class="dream-subhead">Small steps towards sustainable environment</p>
                <p>In total, 40.33M quantities of products have been exported worldwide. It is analysed that the most preferred mode of shipment is air. Analysis reveals that the preferred mode of shipment is air, despite its rapid delivery but concerning environmental implications.  In order to tackle the environmental impact and take small steps towards a sustainable future, the management took decision to commit to minimizing the utilization of air transportation services in particular after 1st July 2023.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/infographics/universalExport/data viz-4.png" alt="Small steps towards sustainable environment">
                <p>In the previous year, a total of 18.87 million packages were shipped via air, the most favoured mode among air, land, and sea. Following the decision, a notable impact has been observed from this initiative. There has been a 24% reduction in the total products sent via air in the second half of 2023 compared to the first half of the year, aligning with our future objectives. This illustrates our commitment to responsible business practices and environmental stewardship.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, Universal Export's performance in 2023 reflects both strengths and areas for improvement. Additionally, while our global exports have propelled us to success, they come with environmental costs, prompting us to commit to reducing air transportation usage for sustainability. The significant reduction in air shipments in the latter half of 2023 demonstrates our dedication to responsible practices. Overall, our commitment to innovation, customer satisfaction, and environmental stewardship positions us well for continued success in the future. We remain focused on leveraging our strengths and addressing weaknesses to deliver sustainable growth and value to our shareholders.</p>
